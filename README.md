# MobileML
Mobile Machine Learning

Simple MNIST:
  * Machine Learning model created using PyCharm with Tensorflow (basic linear regression)
  * This is a simple digit prediction application for Android.
  * Currect model accuracy is about 92% (which is further decreased because of the hand drawn image set used).
  * The App will load the next Hand Drawn image, then convert it into a flattened array, and finally feed it into the ML model to make a prediction.
  * Displays the 1st and 2nd choice in TextView.
