Mobile Machine Learning

Simple MNIST:
  This is a simple digit prediction application for Android.
  This is my first Machine Learning project, therefore, it is very simple.
  Currect model accuracy is about 92% (which is further decreased because of the hand drawn image set used).
  The App will load the next Hand Drawn image, then convert it into a flattened array, and finally feed it into the ML model to make a prediction.
  I display the 1st and 2nd choice.
